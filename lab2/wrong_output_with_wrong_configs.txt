King
1 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
2 Moreover that we much did long to see you,
3 The need we have to use you did provoke
4 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
5 Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,
6 Since nor the exterior nor the inward man
7 Resembles that it was. What it should be,
8 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
9 So much from the understanding of himself,
10 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both
11 That, being of so young days brought up with him,
12 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
13 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
14 Some little time: so by your companies
15 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
16 So much as from occasion you may glean,
17 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
18 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

Queen
19 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
20 And sure I am two men there are not living
21 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
22 To show us so much gentry and good-will
23 As to expend your time with us awhile,
24 For the supply and profit of our hope,
25 Your visitation shall receive such thanks
26 As fits a king's remembrance.

Rosencrantz
27 Both your majesties
28 Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
29 Put your dread pleasures more into command
30 Than to entreaty.

Guildenstern
31 We both obey,
32 And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
33 To lay our service freely at your feet,
34 To be commanded.

King
35 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

Queen
36 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
37 And I beseech you instantly to visit
38 My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you,
39 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

Guildenstern
40 Heavens make our presence and our practices
41 Pleasant and helpful to him!

Queen
42 Ay, amen!
[Exit Guildenstern.]
[Exit Rosencrantz.]
[Exit Queen.]
[Exit King.]
