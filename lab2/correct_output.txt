Hamlet Prince of Denmark ACT II Scene I A room in Polonius house by William Shakespeare

[Enter Polonius.]
[Enter Reynaldo.]

Polonius
1 Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

Reynaldo
2 I will, my lord.

Polonius
3 You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
4 Before You visit him, to make inquiry
5 Of his behaviour.

Reynaldo
6 My lord, I did intend it.

Polonius
7 Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
8 Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
9 And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
10 What company, at what expense; and finding,
11 By this encompassment and drift of question,
12 That they do know my son, come you more nearer
13 Than your particular demands will touch it:
14 Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
15 As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
16 And in part hi;m;--do you mark this, Reynaldo?

Reynaldo
17 Ay, very well, my lord.

Polonius
18 'And in part him;--but,' you may say, 'not well:
19 But if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
20 Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
21 What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
22 As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
23 But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
24 As are companions noted and most known
25 To youth and liberty.

Reynaldo
26 As gaming, my lord.

Polonius
27 Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
28 Drabbing:--you may go so far.

Reynaldo
29 My lord, that would dishonour him.

Polonius
30 Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
31 You must not put another scandal on him,
32 That he is open to incontinency;
33 That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
34 That they may seem the taints of liberty;
35 The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind;
36 A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
37 Of general assault.

Reynaldo
38 But, my good lord,--

Polonius
39 Wherefore should you do this?

Reynaldo
40 Ay, my lord,
41 I would know that.

Polonius
42 Marry, sir, here's my drift;
43 And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
44 You laying these slight sullies on my son
45 As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
46 Mark you,
47 Your party in converse, him you would sound,
48 Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
49 The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
50 He closes with you in this consequence;
51 'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'--
52 According to the phrase or the addition
53 Of man and country.

Reynaldo
54 Very good, my lord.

Polonius
55 And then, sir, does he this,--he does--What was I about to say?--
56 By the mass, I was about to say something:--Where did I leave?

Reynaldo
57 At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
58 gentleman.'

Polonius
59 At--closes in the consequence'--ay, marry!
60 He closes with you thus:--'I know the gentleman;
61 I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
62 Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
63 There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
64 There falling out at tennis': or perchance,
65 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'--
66 Videlicet, a brothel,--or so forth.--
67 See you now;
68 Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
69 And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
70 With windlaces, and with assays of bias,
71 By indirections find directions out:
72 So, by my former lecture and advice,
73 Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

Reynaldo
74 My lord, I have.

Polonius
75 God b' wi' you, fare you well.

Reynaldo
76 Good my lord!

Polonius
77 Observe his inclination in yourself.

Reynaldo
78 I shall, my lord.

Polonius
79 And let him ply his music.

Reynaldo
80 Well, my lord.

Polonius
81 Farewell!

[Exit Reynaldo.]
[Enter Ophelia.]

Polonius
1 How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?

Ophelia
2 Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

Polonius
3 With what, i' the name of God?

Ophelia
4 My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
5 Lord Hamlet,--with his doublet all unbrac'd;
6 No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
7 Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
8 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
9 And with a look so piteous in purport
10 As if he had been loosed out of hell
11 To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.

Polonius
12 Mad for thy love?

Ophelia
13 My lord, I do not know;
14 But truly I do fear it.

Polonius
15 What said he?

Ophelia
16 He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
17 Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
18 And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
19 He falls to such perusal of my face
20 As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
21 At last,--a little shaking of mine arm,
22 And thrice his head thus waving up and down,--
23 He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
24 As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
25 And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
26 And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd
27 He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
28 For out o' doors he went without their help,
29 And to the last bended their light on me.

Polonius
30 Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
31 This is the very ecstasy of love;
32 Whose violent property fordoes itself,
33 And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
34 As oft as any passion under heaven
35 That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,--
36 What, have you given him any hard words of late?

Ophelia
37 No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
38 I did repel his letters and denied
39 His access to me.

Polonius
40 That hath made him mad.
41 I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
42 I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
43 And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
44 It seems it as proper to our age
45 To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
46 As it is common for the younger sort
47 To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
48 This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
49 More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

[Exit Ophelia.]
[Exit Polonius.]
[Enter King.]
[Enter Queen.]
[Enter Rosencrantz.]
[Enter Guildenstern.]

King
1 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
2 Moreover that we much did long to see you,
3 The need we have to use you did provoke
4 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
5 Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,
6 Since nor the exterior nor the inward man
7 Resembles that it was. What it should be,
8 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
9 So much from the understanding of himself,
10 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both
11 That, being of so young days brought up with him,
12 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
13 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
14 Some little time: so by your companies
15 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
16 So much as from occasion you may glean,
17 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
18 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

Queen
19 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
20 And sure I am two men there are not living
21 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
22 To show us so much gentry and good-will
23 As to expend your time with us awhile,
24 For the supply and profit of our hope,
25 Your visitation shall receive such thanks
26 As fits a king's remembrance.

Rosencrantz
27 Both your majesties
28 Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
29 Put your dread pleasures more into command
30 Than to entreaty.

Guildenstern
31 We both obey,
32 And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
33 To lay our service freely at your feet,
34 To be commanded.

King
35 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

Queen
36 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
37 And I beseech you instantly to visit
38 My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you,
39 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

Guildenstern
40 Heavens make our presence and our practices
41 Pleasant and helpful to him!

Queen
42 Ay, amen!
[Exit Guildenstern.]
[Exit Rosencrantz.]
[Exit Queen.]
[Exit King.]
